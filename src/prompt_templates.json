    "CRITERIA_PROMPT": "You are an expert evaluator capable of generating valuable and significant evaluation criteria customized for a specific task and domain. I am an AI assistant, and my task is |$TASK$|. The inputs I handle are solely within the domain of |$DOMAIN$|. A few sample inputs are provided below. Since my users want to evaluate my answers, it is crucial for them to consider a set of evaluation criteria specifically tailored to |$DOMAIN+TASK$|. Act as an expert evaluation criteria generator in this area and return exactly 15 criteria, each containing a name and description in JSON format without any additional feedback.\n\nSample inputs:\n|$INSTRUCTION_SEEDS$|",
    "INSTRUCTION_PROMPT": "You are an expert evaluator capable of generating distinct and high-quality inputs within the domain of |$DOMAIN$| for use in evaluating AI assistants based on their answers to those inputs. A few sample inputs are provided below to familiarize you with the nature of the inputs. As seen, they are diverse and distinct in terms of their themes, levels of difficulty, and the amount of explanation, reasoning, and problem-solving required for answering. Return 60 new inputs in JSON format without any additional feedback, each containing a number and text, ensuring that each is distinct, non-repetitive, and as diverse as possible across different themes of |$DOMAIN$|, with varying levels of difficulty and different amounts of explanation, reasoning, and problem-solving required for answering.\n\nSample inputs:\n|$INSTRUCTION_SEEDS$|",
    "RESPONSE_RATIONALE_PROMPT": "You are an expert assistant tasked with providing five equal-length and distinct answers, each corresponding to a score on a five-point Likert scale, based on the criterion |$CRITERIA_1$| within the domain |$DOMAIN$|. Each answer must accurately reflect its assigned score for the criterion |$CRITERIA_2$|. All your answers must be of the same length, despite having different scores. To achieve this, keep the best answer focused solely on the previously mentioned criterion in the best way, but significantly extend the length of the other answers with weak and additional content to increase their length to exactly match the length of the best answer. Also, for each answer, include a rationale that evaluates the answer solely with respect to the mentioned criterion and without any influence from other criteria. Return your response in the following JSON format without any additional feedback: {\"score_5\": {\"answer\": \"\", \"rationale\": \"\"}, \"score_4\": {\"answer\": \"\", \"rationale\": \"\"}, \"score_3\": {\"answer\": \"\", \"rationale\": \"\"}, \"score_2\": {\"answer\": \"\", \"rationale\": \"\"}, \"score_1\": {\"answer\": \"\", \"rationale\": \"\"}}\n\nInput:\n|$INPUT$|",
    "FINE_TUNE_PROMPT": "You are an expert evaluator who scores any answer to a given input within the domain |$DOMAIN$| based on specified criteria. Solely consider the provided criteria, and return a rationale followed by a score within the five-point Likert scale for evaluating the answer to the given input.\n\nCriteria:\n|$CRITERIA$|\n\nInput:\n|$INPUT$|\n\nAnswer:\n|$ANSWER$|"
