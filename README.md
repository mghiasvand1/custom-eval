How can finite sums be used to estimate real-world quantities that change continuously over an interval?

Answer:

Finite sums can be used to estimate real-world quantities that change continuously over an interval. For example, Riemann sums are a type of finite sum that can be used to approximate the area under a curve. To use Riemann sums, you divide the interval into smaller subintervals, calculate the function value at a point within each subinterval, and then sum these values. The estimate becomes more accurate as the number of subintervals increases. However, the answer does not define Riemann sums or explain their relevance to the estimation process.
